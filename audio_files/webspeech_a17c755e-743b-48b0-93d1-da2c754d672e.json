  "text": "The Minimum Oxygen Concentration (MOC) is explained in section \"Minimum Oxygen Concentration (MOC)\" (page 31).  It's the lowest oxygen concentration at which a combustion reaction can generate enough energy to sustain itself.  Below the MOC, the reaction can't produce sufficient heat to keep the entire mixture at a temperature needed for continued burning.  Industries often use inerting\u2014diluting the oxygen concentration\u2014to prevent fires by keeping the oxygen level below the MOC.",
