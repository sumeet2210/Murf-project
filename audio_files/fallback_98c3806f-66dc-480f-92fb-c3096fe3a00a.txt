Text: The provided document doesn't detail the specific causes of fires in general.  It only describes one accident where a vapor cloud, likely of rich oil and gas, ignited, possibly by the ignition system of engine-driven recompressors.  This is described in the accident report section.

To understand fire causes in general, you'd need to consult a different resource.  Generally, fire requires three elements: a fuel source, an oxidizer (usually oxygen), and an ignition source.  The absence of any one of these prevents a fire.
